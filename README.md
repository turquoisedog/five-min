### What the hell is this?
It's a pretty standard photo gallery.

It serves as both a pet project, learning fixation,
and most importantly, a custom-written Rails app I'm
writing for my dear wolf friend who does photography.

Some model names/parts are left open-ended
('groups' instead of 'albums') in case I wanna reuse/adapt this
code to something fancier along the way.

#### Dependencies
- Ruby 3
- Rails 7
- `sassc`
- `yarn`
- `npm`
- `libexif`
- i forgor ðŸ’€

#### What the hell does the name mean?
It's not important. Those who know, know. lol

Kinda has a nice ring to it tho.

### Set this repo up to develop
Three(!!) easy steps ðŸ™‚

1. Clone it `&&` cd into it
2. `rails db:migrate`
3. `bin/dev` (to watch & recompile assets, as well as server)
